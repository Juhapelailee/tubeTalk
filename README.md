# tubeTalk - a youtube video chatBot!
---
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that answers user's queries on the basis of video's transcripts as a context.
It combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with vector search to provide context-aware answers about the videos.

**Problem Statement**  
YouTube has become one of the most widely used platforms for learning and entertainment. However, the majority of videos are long, often filled with unnecessary commentary or digressions. Users frequently invest 15 minutes to 1 hour before realizing that a video does not meet their needs. While this time waste may be negligible for a single video, it compounds significantly across multiple videos without user realizing that they are wasting majority of their time.

**Proposed Solution**  
This is where a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based chat system comes into play that allows users to interact with YouTube videos in natural language. Instead of passively watching, users can ask targeted questions such as : “Does the video explain about water guns ?”, “Summarize the video”, “who does the video pick as better player: Messi or Ronaldo ?”. This way user can get a lot of  details of the video besides the creator's tempting description and decide whether the video is right fit or not.

🚀 **Highlights**
  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): answers are based enhanced context of videos fed to the LLm
- Secure Setup: Environment variables for API keys; .gitignore prevents sensitive files from leaking.
